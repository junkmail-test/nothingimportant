The music from this period adopts a more somber and subdued tone compared to his earlier work, replacing the baby-voice delivery with an early form of his raspy vocal style.

However, this didn’t last long, as he was booked for multiple festivals across Europe in the summer of 2023. While in Europe, Carti rented out a cave in Paris and recorded various songs there. The songs made during this period were more experimental and unlike the rest of his music. Tracks like POP OUT, MEET YO MAKER, and DOCTOR were all recorded in these caves, with most of the production handled by F1LTHY. Carti eventually moved away from this cave sound and explored a darker theme. The only song from this era (that we know of at least) to see an official release was POP OUT. The cover for this era is fanmade (was originally thought to be real but turns out RunAw lied about the entire thing) & references a Cannibal Corpse album cover.",,,,,Album Details

After a failed rollout in January 2023, Carti revamped the album concept, embracing a darker, gothic, and metal-inspired musical aesthetic. This new sound was driven by gritty beats, mainly produced by Cardo Got Wings, and a mix of deep, menacing vocal delivery with his signature whispery, melodic style. In 2023, Carti largely went silent, resurfacing in July with a feature on Travis Scott's UTOPIA on the track ""FE!N,"" which showcased his newly adopted deep vocal tone. In December 2023, he dropped the first single, ""DIFFERENT DAY,"" followed by ""2024,"" which highlighted both his vocal range and a shift toward sample-based production. Singles like ""HBA,"" ""BACKR00MS"" with Travis Scott, ""EVIL J0RDAN,"" and ""KETAMINE"" continued to generate anticipation. He also featured on major projects, including VULTURES 1 and We Don't Trust You, maintaining his presence in the spotlight. The album's release in March 2025 was highly anticipated, marking a significant evolution in Carti's sound. This was also the first time Carti has incorporated AI into his music, using Keith Lawson to record songs for him and run it through a filter to turn it into his voice. Songs like RATHER LIE and FINE SHIT are very clearly AI tracks.",,,,,Album Details
