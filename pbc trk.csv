Highlighted Producers:
- Pi'erre Bourne
- Southside",,"Die Lit is Playboi Carti’s debut studio album and a follow-up to his eponymous debut mixtape. The album is executively produced by Pi'erre Bourne and boasts features from Young Thug, Lil Uzi Vert, Travis Scott, Nicki Minaj, and Skepta, among many others. Die Lit is a reminder of the power of simplicity, as the album is full of effortless vibes and hypnotic flows that create an array of catchy, uncomplicated tracks. Carti explores different vocal inflections, and he emphasizes his Atlanta accent in his delivery. Before the album’s release, fifteen songs recorded during production of the album were leaked online. However, only four of the leaked tracks were actually on the album; these are “Shoota” (the leaked version was a rough demo), “Love Hurts,” “Choppa Won’t Miss,” and “Foreign.” On May 2, 2018, Carti officially released “Love Hurts” on SoundCloud as the album’s lead single.",,,

(Blonde Era, Baby Voice Era, Opium Era)","(Summer 2019) In Line, Bitch Boy, & u kan do it too are recorded, Carti pushes his baby voice even further & locks in with Richie Souf
(Sept 27th, 2019) Carti fails to drop in the next 60 days, Carti begins reworking the project & being as active on social media
(Apr 14th, 2020) @ MEH releases and receives poor reception from fans & critics
(June 28th, 2020) BigSosa, Carti's long-time friend passes away, Carti goes into hiatus & explores a darker sound",,"
Highlighted Producers:
- Art Dealer
- Pi'erre Bourne
- Richie Souf

",,"The second iteration of Whole Lotta Red represents Carti’s peak of experimentation, extending his use of the “baby voice” and high-pitched vocals to new extremes. During this period, he collaborated with Pi’erre Bourne, Richie Souf, and Art Dealer, performing over a blend of ethereal synth-driven production and hard trap beats. However, following the mixed reception to the single “@ MEH,” Carti abandoned and reworked the project prior to its final release. The cover art associated with this era comes from the “@ MEH” single, marking a transitional phase in his career.  Carti also underwent a significant aesthetic transformation, dyeing his hair blonde, transitioning from freeform dreads to re-twists, and embracing avant-garde fashion, particularly Rick Owens. The upside-down cross became a central motif in his imagery, symbolically tied to his Opium collective. Although divisive at the time, the V2 sound is now widely regarded as a fan favorite, with many of its tracks considered grails, solidifying this as one of the most experimental and influential phases of his career.",,,

",,"Following the death of his friend Bigg Sosa, Carti delayed the release of the album and withdrew from social media until October, when he returned to announce the rollout of his second studio album, Whole Lotta Red. While Carti is not typically recognized for lyrical depth, several tracks address the grief he experienced after Bigg Sosa’s passing and his methods of coping, most notably on ILoveUIHateU, where he reflects on his struggles with drug addiction. The music from this period adopts a more somber and subdued tone compared to his earlier work, replacing the baby-voice delivery with an early form of his raspy vocal style. This artistic shift was partly a response to the widespread criticism directed at his use of the baby-voice, leading him to explore a darker and more aggressive approach. According to leakers, a September version of Whole Lotta Red existed with a finalized tracklist, although it is unlikely this version will ever be publicly heard.",,,

",,"In late 2020, Carti shifted the sound of Whole Lotta Red into an aggressive ode to punk rock aesthetics, while maintaining the repetitive vocal style that made his previous work so loved. The album was his biggest musical departure by far, forgoing most of the things that brought him success in the first place, such as production from Pi'erre Bourne or features from popular collaborators like Lil Uzi Vert or A$AP Rocky. Instead, the album featured only a handful of guest appearances and production predominantly handled by F1LTHY and Art Dealer. Connecting to V3, Carti uses this album to talk about his acts of violence, expressing how he felt when Bigg Sosa died, moving from grief to anger. On songs like “On That Time,” “Stop Breathing,” and “No Sl33p,” he opens up about his emotions, displaying anger, sometimes sadness, and vengeance for his friend.

",,"One day after the release of Whole Lotta Red, Carti took to Twitter to ask fans which songs they wanted on a deluxe edition, marking the first time he had ever planned a deluxe release for one of his projects. Many of the songs considered for the deluxe were already well-known leaks, alongside potential new tracks created specifically for the project. These songs underwent multiple tweaks and changes, including mixing, mastering, and name changes, in preparation for an official release. Two tracklist versions of the deluxe have been revealed by insiders and leakers, with speculation that more versions may exist but have yet to surface. Carti eventually went silent about the deluxe, and the project was shelved. It is rumored that the label did not allow him to release it, forcing him to abandon it and focus on his next album, NARCISSIST.",,,

Fans speculated the album might be called Mollyworld after a fit-pic caption, but Narcissist was the final name. The project hinted at a futuristic, sample-heavy sound, blending Carti’s fading “baby voice” with a developing deeper tone, a shift later heard on Travis Scott’s “FE!N.” Leaks like “Sights” and “Too Hot” showcased his evolving style. Despite a producer lineup that potentially included Richie Souf, F1lthy, and Art Dealer, the album was scrapped, and the tour was renamed King Vamp.

",,"In early 2023, anticipation for Playboi Carti’s next album was through the roof. He had just previewed “ROCKSTARZ” at Rolling Loud California, and it felt like the album could drop any week. Around this time, DJ Swamp Izzo emerged as a trusted insider in the Carti community, sharing key info in DMs with a fan. He claimed Carti had a few possible titles in mind, despite previously teasing the name MUSIC in 2022, and said the official title would drop in two weeks (which never happened). This led to speculation about whether this was a new project, or just MUSIC under a different name. Swamp also mentioned that about 25 tracks were in consideration and hinted at an April or May release. Swamp stated that he would speak over each song, something that later became a main gimmick of MUSIC when it released, and that the sound for the tape was inspired by Lil Wayne, with Carti blending all of his sounds together with a touch of 2000s Atlanta trap. After two grueling years of constant blueballing, Carti finally dropped MUSIC, and once it was out, more details surfaced about the behind-the-scenes process. In an April 2025 interview Swamp Izzo revealed Carti had completed an entire tape by the end of 2022, but no tracks from it made the final tracklist for MUSIC.",,,

F1LTHY also tweeted the words '004KT' (00 meaning Opium and 4KT standing for YoungBoys label) hinting at his potetional involvement in a collaboration between the two. The album was in the works up until early 2024, when YoungBoy was raided and arrested for running a large scale drug ring.",,,

However, this didn’t last long, as he was booked for multiple festivals across Europe in the summer of 2023. While in Europe, Carti rented out a cave in Paris and recorded various songs there. The songs made during this period were more experimental and unlike the rest of his music. Tracks like POP OUT, MEET YO MAKER, and DOCTOR were all recorded in these caves, with most of the production handled by F1LTHY. Carti eventually moved away from this cave sound and explored a darker theme. The only song from this era (that we know of at least) to see an official release was POP OUT. The cover for this era is fanmade (was originally thought to be real but turns out RunAw lied about the entire thing) & references a Cannibal Corpse album cover.",,,

In 2023, Carti largely went silent, resurfacing in July with a feature on Travis Scott's UTOPIA on the track ""FE!N,"" which showcased his newly adopted deep vocal tone. In December 2023, he dropped the first single, ""DIFFERENT DAY,"" followed by ""2024,"" which highlighted both his vocal range and a shift toward sample-based production.

He also featured on major projects, including VULTURES 1 and We Don't Trust You, maintaining his presence in the spotlight. The album's release in March 2025 was highly anticipated, marking a significant evolution in Carti's sound. This was also the first time Carti has incorporated AI into his music, using Keith Lawson to record songs for him and run it through a filter to turn it into his voice. Songs like RATHER LIE and FINE SHIT are very clearly AI tracks.",,,

CARTI YE is a collaborative project between Playboi Carti and Kanye West. Little is known of the album, except that sessions for the project took place and it was ultimately scrapped. Kanye posted the album cover on X on March 15, 2025, alongside confirming that the project was discontinued. Later on a stream, F1LTHY would come out and claim that it was actually a track meant for their scrapped collaborative album ""CARTI YE"".Ye uploading it without Carti was most likely part of the episode he was having at the time, incidently starting a beef with Carti. YoungBoy for his part, decided to stick to Carti's side generating more anticipation for future collaborations.
